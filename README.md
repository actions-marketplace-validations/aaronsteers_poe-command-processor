# Poe Command Processor

A GitHub Action to execute [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) commands in your repository, designed for use with slash commands in PR comments. This action can automatically commit changes back to the pull request branch or create a new PR if needed.

## Features

- ✅ Runs any Poe command in your repository.
- ✅ Supports triggering via slash commands in PR and issue comments.
- ✅ Can auto-commit changes to the PR branch, or open a new PR if no PR exists.
- ✅ Posts status updates and results as comments on the originating comment.
- ✅ Infers commands from comment bodies for seamless gitops/chatops workflows.

## Inputs

| Name           | Description                                                                 | Required | Default  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| `command`      | Poe command to run. If not provided, inferred from the body of the specified `comment-id`. | false    |          |
| `pr`           | Pull Request number.                                                        | false    |          |
| `comment-id`   | Comment ID (for reply chaining and command inference).                      | false    |          |
| `github-token` | GitHub Token. Required for CI to run after commits are pushed.              | false    |          |
| `no-commit`    | Disable auto-commit step.                                                   | false    | `false`  |

## Usage

### Basic Example

```yaml
- name: Run Poe Command
  uses: aaronsteers/poe-command-processor@v1
  with:
    command: "lint"
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    pr: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

### Slash Command Example

This action is designed to work with slash commands in PR comments. If you omit the `command` input and provide a `comment-id`, the action will extract the command from the comment body.

```yaml
- name: Run Poe Command from Comment
  uses: aaronsteers/poe-command-processor@v1
  with:
    comment-id: ${{ github.event.comment.id }}
    pr: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

If the comment body is `/poe lint`, the action will run `poe lint`.

### Auto-Commit and PR Creation

- If changes are made and `no-commit` is not set to `true`, the action will auto-commit changes to the PR branch.
- If no PR is provided, the action will create a new draft PR with the results.
- Status and result comments are posted back to the PR or issue thread.

## Requirements

- Your repository must use [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) and have a valid `pyproject.toml`,  `poe_tasks.toml`, or similar config file containing the project's Poe tasks.
- The action sets up Python 3.11 and installs dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
- Your project should have a poe task named `install` which will run before any other requested command.
- The `github-token` input is required for committing changes and posting comments.
- Optional: If a `.tool-versions` file exists in the root of your repository, this action will automatically use it to determine the versions of `poetry`, `python`, and `uv`, provided matching entries are found. (See below.)

## Tool Versions

This action will attempt to use a `.tool-versions` file in your repo, if one esists. This behavior is powered by the [marocchino/tool-versions-action](https://github.com/marocchino/tool-versions-action). No additional configuration is required to enable this feature.

If a `.tool-versions` file does not exist, or doesn't have versions specified, we will try with the following defaults:

- `uv` - Default to latest version.
- `poetry` - Default to latest version.
- `python` - Default to version 3.11.

## Publishing Task Output

Tasks can optionally publish markdown output that will appear in both the GitHub job summary and as an expandable section in PR comments. This is useful for displaying test results, coverage reports, or other structured output.

### How It Works

To publish output, your poe task should check for the `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` environment variable and write markdown content to it:

```shell
# In your poe task (pyproject.toml or poe_tasks.toml)
[tasks.my-task]
shell = """
if [ -n "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY" ]; then
  echo '## Task Results' >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
  echo '' >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
  echo '- ✅ Step 1: Success' >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
  echo '- ✅ Step 2: Success' >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
  echo '' >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
  echo '**Status**: All steps completed! 🎉' >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
fi
# Your actual task logic here
echo 'Task completed'
"""
```

The output will appear:
- In the GitHub Actions job summary (visible in the workflow run page)
- In PR comments as an expandable section with ✳️ "Show/Hide Summary Output" (on success) or ✴️ (on failure)

**Note:** Always check if `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is defined before writing to it, as this variable is only available in GitHub Actions environments.
